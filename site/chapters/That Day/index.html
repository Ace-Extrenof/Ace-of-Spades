<h1 id="chapter-1-that-day">Chapter 1: "That Day"</h1>
<p>It’s been two years since I moved from India to New York, and there have been many difficulties… like communication problems, cultural differences, etc etc… But I don’t care. I’m having fun with my little brother and sister and that’s all I want.</p>
<p>And it’s April 18 today! My birthday! I’ve been thinking about it the whole day and I can’t stop thinking about it, heck, I even skipped my study sessions today because of that… Who cares, I’m smart enough anyway…</p>
<p>“Ace! You asleep yet?!” A shout came from downstairs.</p>
<p><em>Mom’s coming!</em></p>
<p>I quickly turned off the light and covered my face with the blanket. <em>Hot! I have put up with it for a while.</em></p>
<p>After some time the door made a creaking sound.</p>
<p>“We have to oil the door…” Ace’s mom said and glanced at Ace.
<em>He’s sleeping early…</em> she thought.
She walked over to the other side of the bed and looked over at Aces’ face which was covered by the blanket. She looked at him for a while and after some time she left while closing the door carefully.
She left…</p>
<p><a class="glightbox" href="../assets/scene.png" data-type="image" data-width="auto" data-height="auto" data-desc-position="bottom"><img alt="scene break" src="../assets/scene.png" /></a></p>
<p><em>Hehe… Paneer… So tasty… GIMME MORE!</em></p>
<p>“Brother!” A little girl shouted.</p>
<p><em>Cake… Mm.</em></p>
<p>“Wake up!” She shouted again.</p>
<p><em>Lyla…</em></p>
<p>“BROTHER WAKE UP!” She shouted.</p>
<p>Ace got up swiftly and looked around but he couldn’t see anything.</p>
<p><em>Blurry...</em></p>
<p>The little girl picked up spectacles from the table beside the bed and thrusted it into Aces’ eyes.</p>
<p>“Ow! ow… That hurt…” He grimaced.</p>
<p>I saw a little girl with brownish hair in front of me with a frown on her face. She stared at me for some time and then her face broke into a smile.</p>
<p>“You’re so clumsy!” She poked my cheek.</p>
<p>I smiled and said,  “Can’t help it…”</p>
<p>“It’s 10:00 a.m go and brush your teeth, we’ll have breakfast somewhere special.” She said.</p>
<p><em>Ahh… such a cute sister… WAIT WHAT 10:00 a.m?!</em></p>
<p>I jumped out of my bed and dashed outside the room.</p>
<p><em>Such a clumsy brother...</em> I thought.</p>
<p><a class="glightbox" href="../assets/scene.png" data-type="image" data-width="auto" data-height="auto" data-desc-position="bottom"><img alt="scene break" src="../assets/scene.png" /></a></p>
<p><em>Oh no, no… I got up late!</em></p>
<p>I dashed into the bathroom and in a second I was brushing my teeth as fast as I could.</p>
<p><em>Wait… how did she enter my room?</em></p>
<p>I put water into my mouth, gargled and spit it out, and ran towards my room at full speed, also to brag a bit, I had a reasonably high-speed stat, enough to go into nationals maybe… But that doesn’t matter, I’m not interested in it anyway, what does matter is where would they take me today? Maybe a family restaurant? No, a bit too cliché for my parents, well I’ll just stop guessing for now, I want to maintain the ‘surprise’ element for the surprise they have for me.</p>
<p>I ran into my room picked out the clothes that were the most close to me and changed.</p>
<p>I saw myself in the mirror and I looked pretty good to be honest, I was always surprised by the luck I had when it came to fashion sense. I bet all people who have the ‘no-fashion-sense’ trait will be burning from jealously.</p>
<p>Speaking of ‘luck’, a lot of things have been pretty peaceful in my life for quite some time, except the bullying, uhm… a lot more, maybe?</p>
<p>“C’mon already! How much time you gonna take?!” Lyla raised her voice from outside.</p>
<p>“Just a second!” I also raised my voice from inside.</p>
<p>I quickly ran towards the door and opened it swiftly in excitement, and there she was, my angelic sister in her angelic clothes… </p>
<p><em>I bet my sister complex is greater than any anime <a href="http://www.romajidesu.com/dictionary/meaning-of-oniisan.html">onii-san</a></em></p>
<p>I shook my head and stepped out of my room careful to not look at my sister’s brilliance which could blind me eternally.</p>
<p>“You’re acting weird…” She said in a curious voice.</p>
<p>“I’m always weird.” I replied as I ran down downstairs, she followed behind me.</p>
<p>“But this time you’re like <em>weird</em> weird,” she said as she looked at me but suspicion.</p>
<p>“Maybe I’m just a little too excited right now...” I said as we reached the bottom floor.</p>
<p>I was instantly greeted by my brother Sam who was grabbing heaps of cheese balls out of a bag of Cheezos and shoving it inside his mouth.</p>
<p>“<em>Hapwe Bwarthdwe!</em>” He mumbled out as he kept eating.</p>
<p>Lyla walked over to him climbed up the chair and smacked Sam’s head.</p>
<p><em>Oof…</em></p>
<p>I walked near them picked Lyla from the chair and put her down.</p>
<p>“You shouldn’t just smack someone when you’re eating…” I crouched and said to her.</p>
<p>“But it’s your birthday and he couldn’t even give you a proper greeting!” She pouted as she said.</p>
<p><em>She did that for me! [sparkling face effect]</em></p>
<p>I picked her up and put her back on the chair.</p>
<p>“It’s fine…” I said smugly and walked towards the kitchen.</p>
<p>“<em>Cough-</em> Where are mom and dad?” Sam asked as he swallowed the last of his Cheetos.</p>
<p>“I don’t know maybe they went to get stuff ready…” I poured myself a drink from the fridge and drank it all in one go.</p>
<p>“You should get friends y’know…” Sam said in a low voice.</p>
<p><em><a href="https://www.google.com/imgres?q=emotional%20damage&amp;imgurl=https%3A%2F%2Fuploads.dailydot.com%2F2023%2F11%2Femotional-damage-meme.jpg%3Fauto%3Dcompress%26fm%3Dpjpg&amp;imgrefurl=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.dailydot.com%2Fnews%2Femotional-damage-meme%2F&amp;docid=n0YvfSNj3d5PhM&amp;tbnid=Z9ZWDvxr4NYsZM&amp;vet=12ahUKEwjG_La3_62GAxWXTWcHHbH0CbAQM3oECHMQAA..i&amp;w=2000&amp;h=1000&amp;hcb=2&amp;ved=2ahUKEwjG_La3_62GAxWXTWcHHbH0CbAQM3oECHMQAA">Emotional damage...</a></em></p>
<p>“I don’t need them, I’m fine on my own,” I replied sharply.</p>
<p>“Huh? You heard that?”</p>
<p>“You forgot? He has superhuman abilities…” Lyla said as she climbed down the chair.</p>
<p><em>Just genetics playing their part...</em></p>
<p>I screamed in my mind to shake off the <a href="https://www.google.com/imgres?q=emotional%20damage&amp;imgurl=https%3A%2F%2Fuploads.dailydot.com%2F2023%2F11%2Femotional-damage-meme.jpg%3Fauto%3Dcompress%26fm%3Dpjpg&amp;imgrefurl=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.dailydot.com%2Fnews%2Femotional-damage-meme%2F&amp;docid=n0YvfSNj3d5PhM&amp;tbnid=Z9ZWDvxr4NYsZM&amp;vet=12ahUKEwjG_La3_62GAxWXTWcHHbH0CbAQM3oECHMQAA..i&amp;w=2000&amp;h=1000&amp;hcb=2&amp;ved=2ahUKEwjG_La3_62GAxWXTWcHHbH0CbAQM3oECHMQAA">emotional damage</a> and sighed.</p>
<p>“I don’t need friends, I’m fine with both of you…” I mumbled.</p>
<p>“No, you can’t be, you need to get friends!” They both said at the same time.</p>
<p>“And you call me superhuman…” I replied as I smiled.</p>
<p>“The ride’s here!” A loud voice came from outside.</p>
<p>“Dad’s here…” Lyla said in an unsurprising voice.</p>
<p><em>Shouldn’t daughters be more excited when their dad comes home?</em></p>
<p>“Let’s go!” Sam sprang up from the chair and ran towards the front door.</p>
<p>“There’ll also be food there!” I shouted as I grabbed Lyla and walked outside.</p>
<p>“This isn’t about food!” Sam yelled back.</p>
<p><a class="glightbox" href="../assets/scene.png" data-type="image" data-width="auto" data-height="auto" data-desc-position="bottom"><img alt="scene break" src="../assets/scene.png" /></a></p>
<p>It took about 2 hours to complete the trip from home to the place we were visiting.</p>
<p>After getting out of the van, I instantly got super excited because there was a large mall-like building in front of us with food stalls surrounding the whole building leaving space for the road. And the most important part, the was a large sign on top of the building that said “SCIENCE EXHIBIT”.</p>
<p><em>I can finally meet with fellow nerds and talk about physics, chemistry, and biology what not, all day long...</em></p>
<p>“Whipeee!” I yelled as I made a beeline towards the main gate.</p>
<p>“Hey wait! Dad said that we should stick together!” Sam and Lyla came running from behind.</p>
<p><em>Okay, okay, I know you’re excited but don’t forget big brother responsibility…</em></p>
<p>“Oops, sorry…” I apologized and looked again at the building.</p>
<p>“It’s huge…” Lyla said as she looked up and down to examine the building.</p>
<p>“It…is, will there be food on the upper floors too?” Sam asked as he also looked up at the building.</p>
<p>“Don’t know… We’ll have to find out!” I lifted my foot to start running but I put my foot back down.</p>
<p>“What happened?” Lyla asked as she ran towards me and tucked my hand.</p>
<p>“Let’s go eat something first…” I said as my stomach cried in the background.</p>
<p>“Yippeee! I’ll go get corn dogs!” Sam got excited and started walking towards the stalls.</p>
<p>I grabbed him by the collar and pulled him towards me.</p>
<p>“Wait a second, we need to stay together,” I said as I started walking towards one of the stalls.</p>
<p>“But you ran away like me earlier…” Sam said as his stomach also cried in the background.</p>
<p>“I learned from my mistakes…”</p>
<p>Another sound came from behind, someone else’s stomach was also crying. We both looked behind and we saw our little sister holding her stomach.</p>
<p>“Hungry...” she said in a low voice.</p>
<p>O’ god of science I don’t deserve such brilliance emitting from this angel…</p>
<p>We eventually found a stall that sold corn dogs, although I had a hard time getting through the crowd that kept pushing, but it was all worth it, the corn dogs were some high-quality stuff and I ended up buying them a second time.</p>
<p>“So good~,” She said as she ate through the corn dog.</p>
<p>But the corn dog itself wasn’t why I didn’t repurchase them, it was so that me and my brother could watch our cute little sister gradually and delicately yet very cutely eat the corn dog.</p>
<p>But we can’t spend all our money, we need to save some to eat when we get out of the exhibit.</p>
<p>We all put our corn dogs in our stomachs for digestion and started walking towards the exhibit, the main attraction, my source of excitement.</p>
<p>“I’ve never seen you so pumped before,” Sam said as he leaned forward and looked at me.</p>
<p>“He looks pretty funny!” Lyla said as she also leaned forward.</p>
<p>“You think so? That’s cause’ I’m excited! I can finally see stuff I want to and am excited about.” I blurted out.</p>
<p>We reached the building’s main entrance and entered the building.</p>
<p>It was like a whole new environment inside, people with white lab coats walked here and there demonstrating different experiments and projects to science enthusiasts.
I randomly picked a scientist and walked towards the experiment he was performing.</p>
<p>The scientist was showing some type of miniature nuclear reactor to everyone.</p>
<p>“-We bring these tiny particles super close together and make them join. When they do, they release a lot of energy, like a big power-up in a video game. This energy is what we use to generate electricity. Unlike some other ways we make energy, fusion doesn’t create harmful stuff, making it a cool and clean way to power things!” Everyone clapped and dispersed in different directions.</p>
<p>It wasn’t anything new, although the way he explained was very good. I can see students liking him.</p>
<p>I began looking around to find something interesting.</p>
<p>“What happened?” Sam asked as he also began looking around.</p>
<p>“Trying to find something interesting…” I replied as I looked left, right, and backward.</p>
<p>“What about that?” Lyla said as she tucked my hand and pointed to a small room on the other side.</p>
<p>There was a yellow sign on top of the roof. “T.E Serum,” it said.</p>
<p>“Way to go sister, you found something interesting,” I said as I concealed my excitement and walked towards the room.</p>
<p>Just when we reached the door a tall figure came leaning out of the door.</p>
<p>“What may I do for you, sir?” He said in a monotonous voice.</p>
<p><em>Chilling vibes…</em></p>
<p>“Just… came to see what they were showing here…” I replied as I stuttered.</p>
<p><em>No, don’t be scared, he’s just a scientist…a fellow science lover like me.</em></p>
<p>“You… mean about T.E.?” There was a hint of surprise in his face.</p>
<p>“Uh, yes…” I straightened my back as I said that.</p>
<p>“Well, then you’re welcome, young man…” he smiled as he moved out of the way and gestured for me to go inside.</p>
<p>I looked back to see my brother and sister and gestured for them to go inside.</p>
<p>We went in and the scientist followed us from behind.</p>
<p><em>Now, don’t kidnap us…</em></p>
<p>The room was small there was a glass tank in the middle which was attached to what looked like a terminal with many buttons.</p>
<p>“Go near the tank I’ll show you something interesting...” he said and walked towards the terminal. I went near the tank with my siblings and examined what was inside.</p>
<p>It looked like a desert terrarium, there was a hollow wood log in the center and a small glass plate outside one of the ends.</p>
<p>“Now watch closely…” he said as he pushed one of the buttons of the buttons on the terminal.</p>
<p>A small hole opened up in the sand and a small robotic arm that held a piece of paper came out.</p>
<p>“Woah…” Sam and Lyla looked at it in awe.</p>
<p>The robotic arm put the piece of paper on the plate and then went back into the hole and disappeared.</p>
<p>When I examined the paper I saw there was something written in it.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>&lt;45x = 360&gt;</p>
</blockquote>
<p>It was a math question.</p>
<p><em>What does he want to do?</em></p>
<p>“Algebra?” I said as I looked at the paper, confused.</p>
<p>“Just wait…” I said as he pushed another button on the terminal.</p>
<p>A lizard came out of the hollow log, he looked at the piece of paper and went back into the log, soon he came back holding a small pencil, but something was different.</p>
<p>“How did he turn blue…” I asked as I looked at the lizard.</p>
<p>The lizard began scribbling on the paper and then went back into the log.
Another button was pushed and a hole opened up in the tank.
The scientist picked up the piece of paper through the hole and the hole closed up.</p>
<p>“Look at this, is this correct?” He asked as he handed the paper to me.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>&lt;45x = 360
x = 360/45
x = 8&gt;</p>
</blockquote>
<p>“He solved it? He solved algebra?!” I said as my hands shook in excitement.
“What did you do?” I asked as I looked at the paper in amazement.</p>
<p>“You look happy, this is the ability of T.E serum, it makes even the stupidest of creatures very smart and-”</p>
<p>As he was speaking the ground shook very badly and the glass tank broke, the concrete began cracking up and made creaking sounds.</p>
<p>“Run!” The scientist pushed the three of us outside and closed the door from behind.</p>
<p>“What’s happening?!” Sam yelled as he and Lyla grabbed me.</p>
<p>“Don’t worry! Just run!” We all began running towards the main entrance.</p>
<p>A huge boulder fell from above blocking the main entrance, then the ground began shaking much faster.
Another boulder fell from above, this time directly above us. I lost my balance and fell forwards pulling my siblings away from the boulders trajectory. The boulder landed and made a huge hole in the ground, the ground surrounding the hole began to break and soon we all fell into the hole.</p>
<p>“AHHHH!” everyone shouted as they went through free fall, we weren’t alone, many people fell with us. That wasn’t the problem.</p>
<p>I grabbed both of my siblings mid-air and turned my back towards the ground and kept my siblings above me.</p>
<p>“BRACE YOURSELVES!” I shouted as we continued to close the gap between us and the ground.</p>
<p>My siblings grasped my body very hard, I couldn’t do anything else, I was dying, or would be dying. It didn’t matter, as long as Sam and Lyla lived.
I hugged them both one last time as I hit the ground below, only a moment to think was left before I lost consciousness.</p>
<p><em>Man, the day I was supposed to enjoy the most was ruined… if heaven is real, then dear god, you’d better repent on your actions, screw you…</em></p>
<p><a class="glightbox" href="../assets/scene.png" data-type="image" data-width="auto" data-height="auto" data-desc-position="bottom"><img alt="scene break" src="../assets/scene.png" /></a></p>
<p>“Ugh…” I groaned as I tried to get up. I couldn’t, something wasn’t letting me.</p>
<p>I tried to face up, but I couldn’t. After struggling for a bit, I was able to see what was blocking me. It was a block of concrete.</p>
<p><em>A block of concrete fell on me? How the hell am I alive?!</em>
I began panicking and tried to find an opening. Soon enough I found a hole, a small one. Fortunately, I could remove some small rocks, move them outside, and make the hole wider to escape.</p>
<p>“GODDAMMIT! WHY WONT’CHA LEAVE ME ALONE!” Someone yelled from outside.</p>
<p><em>What’s happening outside?!</em></p>
<p>I quickly removed some rocks near the hole to make it wide enough to see through.</p>
<p>“FINE! IF YOU WON’T I’LL KILL EVERYBODY! GYAHAHAHAH!” He let out a murderous laugh.</p>
<p>I positioned my head near the hole so I could see what was happening outside. I saw a skinny man with a jet-pack-like thing attached to his back, he was laughing maniacally as robotic arms came out from his jet pack and threw boulders forward.
I struggled to move my head closer to the hole to get a better view. There were three people, moving forward dodging all the boulders the madman threw at them.</p>
<p>“HEY! STOP THIS YOU PIECE OF-” A guy got hit by a boulder and was sent flying towards me as he was shouting.</p>
<p><em>What…</em></p>
<p>I simply lied there. Trying to understand stuff incomprehensible to me, trying to think.</p>
<p><em>What do I…do…</em></p>
<p>The other two people scrambled their way to the fallen guy trying to help him up, then suddenly they leapt and ran away. There was a boulder coming straight at me. I braced for the impact to minimize damage, but why was I minimizing damage? I should’ve been dead.</p>
<p>The boulder hit me, and it hurt, but the concrete block that was not letting me move was shattered. I was free.</p>
<p>I struggled to move out of the debris, then I caught something in my peripheral vision. Two dead bodies lying on the floor.
I struggled my way out of the debris, all my muscles were sore, and it hurt like hell. But I didn’t stop. I couldn’t stop.</p>
<p>“THERE’S A KID HERE!” A woman shouted, but I couldn’t care less.</p>
<p><em>Shut up or the madman will look at me...</em></p>
<p>I gathered all the energy I had in my body and ran all I could towards the dead bodies.</p>
<p>“HEY KID! GET A TASTE OF THIS BOULDER! GYAHAHAH!”</p>
<p><em>Crap...</em></p>
<p>I panicked as I looked to my left, there was a large block of concrete flying towards me. I quickly leapt forward, dodged the boulder, and landed near the two dead bodies.</p>
<p>“GET AWAY!” Someone shouted, but I didn’t listen.</p>
<p>Tears rolled down my eyes as I looked at the two corpses in front of me. The corpses of Lyla and Sam.</p>
<p><em>NO! NO, NO, NO, NO… PLEASE NO!</em></p>
<p>I quickly put my hand on the left side of their chests and checked their pulse. No beat. They weren’t breathing. They’re dead.</p>
<p><em>Why…</em></p>
<p>I hugged the corpses tightly, not believing that they were dead.</p>
<p><em>Why… don’t die on me!</em></p>
<p>“NO USE THEY’RE ALL DEAD! YOUR FAMILY, FRIENDS BLAH BLAH BLAH! I DON’T CARE! THEY’RE ALL DEAD! GYAHAHAH!” He shouted.</p>
<p><em>What… what enjoyment do you… get out of this huh? Do you… think this is funny?! You-</em></p>
<p>I shouted in my mind as a stream of water rolled down my cheeks.</p>
<p><em>Krkkk!</em></p>
<p>Something fell on my head. It felt like glass, my head felt watery. It hurt, hurt real bad.</p>
<p>“WHY?!” I shouted as anger welled up inside me.</p>
<p>I experienced a tingling sensation in my head and suddenly my body seemed like it was a size bigger. It felt like my intelligence was fading away.</p>
<p>"WHAT HAPPENED TO HIM?!" Someone shouted.</p>
<p><a class="glightbox" href="../assets/scene.png" data-type="image" data-width="auto" data-height="auto" data-desc-position="bottom"><img alt="scene break" src="../assets/scene.png" /></a></p>
<p>Shiroko Koneko panicked as she saw the boy’s muscles got bigger.</p>
<p>“Um… What happened to him?!” I shouted as I looked at Jeremy.</p>
<p>“I don’t know! Something fell on him and then his body suddenly got bigger!”</p>
<p>“Either way it’s bad news!” Captain Jim shouted.</p>
<p>The boy got up putting aside the corpses of what seemed like his family.</p>
<p>“What’s he… doing?” Becky came from behind panting heavily.</p>
<p>The boy turned towards the madman. His eyes pure red, his pupils white. There was pure rage in his eyes. His hair turned crimson.</p>
<p>A chill ran down Shiroko’s spine as the boy started walking towards the madman.</p>
<p>“I… got a bad feeling-” Just as she was talking the boy suddenly vanished.</p>
<p>“Wha- where did he go?” Everyone began to look for him.</p>
<p>Then they all saw the madman on the floor. Getting heavy punches drilled into him with every punch created a loud sound.</p>
<p>“STOP HIM HE’S GONNA KILL HIM!” Jim ordered and everyone ran towards the boy.</p>
<p>Every second a large thud concealed the area.</p>
<p><em>Is he trying to kill him?!</em></p>
<p>Everyone ran towards the boy.She panicked and grabbed the boys arm and the boy stopped.</p>
<p><em>I did it!</em></p>
<p>The boy turned around and looked at Shiroko.</p>
<p><em>Eep! Scary!</em></p>
<p>The boy looked back at the madman and continued beating him.</p>
<p><em>It’s not working?!</em></p>
<p>Everyone grabbed the boys right arm which was now covered with blood.</p>
<p>But the boy continued beating him with his left arm.</p>
<p>“NO USE! PULL HIM ASIDE!” Jim ordered and everyone grabbed the boys body and tried to him back.</p>
<p>The boy stopped and then began moving away.</p>
<p>“It’s working…”</p>
<p>The boy vanished again and appeared on top of the madman.</p>
<p>“CRAP IT ISN’T!”</p>
<p>She ran back to him grabbed him again, more like a hug from behind.</p>
<p>“STOP IT!” She yelled. He didn’t stop.</p>

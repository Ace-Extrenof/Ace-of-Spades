Why wouldn\u2019t they? After all, the devil had come to reap their lives.</p> <p>\u201cEveryone don\u2019t let your guard down!\u201d A mercenary shouted But looking at the crowd they probably didn\u2019t give a shit about that. They just wanted to kill the man in front of them who had the bounty of 5 million.</p> <p>Not that they could though, because the in front of them was no ordinary man, you can tell by his 5 million bounty, he was no average Joe, heck his head probably had even more worth than that.</p> <p>\u201cDo they seriously think they can take me on with these numbers?\u201d A shadowy figure said in deep monotonous voice while standing at a pile of bodies.</p> <p>\u201cThey are fools master, they think that they can scratch the great Ambassador with just 500 people\u201d a robot bowed with his head down to the shadowy figure.</p> <p>\u201cThey indeed are\u2026\u201d he had an emotionless face, he showed no concern for what was happening around him.</p> <p>\u201cGive me the \u2018stuff\u2019\u201d he said as he reached his hand forward, \u201cHere, master\u201d a compartment in the robots chest opened, there was a plastic bag in it. He handed the bag with both his arms to the hand.</p> <p>He picked up the bag and opened it, he took out the stuff inside it and started eating it.</p> <p>\u201cMm\u2026 Vera, you never disappoint, your chips are top-notch in terms for seasoning\u201d he kept eating while looking at his surroundings as if he was seeing a movie.</p> <p>\u201cI\u2019m not worthy of such praise master...\u201d Vera modestly turned down his praise.</p> <p>\u201cThe hell is he doing?!\u201d Someone shouted from below.</p> <p>\u201cThey\u2019d better not start making noise all of a sudden when I\u2019m relaxing\u2026\u201d he said as he kept munching down on his chips.</p> <p>It\u2019s such a hassle when people come shouting at you when you\u2019re eating, such a pain in the ass\u2026 he thought, this wasn\u2019t the first time something like this happening to him. He encountered these type of incidents pretty often.</p> <p>\u201cHey, wannabe devil come down here so we can kick ya\u2019 ass!\u201d Another shout came from below.</p> <p>\u201cMy, they\u2019re now badmouthing me\u2026\u201d he said, without his expression changing he still kept eating chips as he analyzed the environment.</p> <p>\u201cMaster, should I take care of them?\u201d  Vera asked while looking down.</p> <p>\u201cNo need. You just enjoy the show\u2026\u201d he gave his tasty bag o\u2019 chips to Vera and jumped down.</p> <p>\u201cUm\u2026 was that really necessary?\u201d Vera questioned as he went down.</p> <p>The answer was that it wasn\u2019t, he just did it to look cool.</p> <p>\u201cHey! Can\u2019t you guys see I\u2019m eating!\u201d He shouted as he landed on the floor.</p> <p>\u201cEVERYONE CHARGE!\u201d A brute came behind from the crowd and started running towards him.</p> <p>\u201cEh\u2026 so you won\u2019t listen to my backstory? No helping it then\u201d he said in a disappointed voice.</p> <p>Everyone charged at him with killing intent, but that didn\u2019t change anything, he was already the winner.</p> <p>The Ambassador put his hand on his face and shifted his bottom part of the palm down revealing this left eye between his thumb and index finger.</p> <p>\u201cDOMINION!\u201d he shouted, his pupils and hair turned golden.</p> <p>\u201cDON\u2019T FALTER!\u201d The brute shouted as he marched forward with increasing speed.</p> <p>\u201cFISSION!\u201d He turned into disappeared, no trace of him except dust particles.</p> <p>\u201cHuh?\u201d The brute was dumbfounded, he looked desperately around to find him. Damn it! Where did that coward run off to?! The brute thought, but the man didn\u2019t run away he had actually turned into subatomic particles because of his speed.</p> <p>When the brute looked behind everyone was lying on the flood. \u201cH-How?!\u201d He grit his teeth. \u201cShow yourself coward!\u201d He shouted.</p> <p>\u201cGeez\u2026 can\u2019t you be a little less louder\u2026\u201d the man said as he came back into being as dust particles gathered.</p> <p>\u201cI\u2019LL KILL YOU!\u201d The brute leaped forward. But the man did nothing he brought up his hand to his left shoulder and swiped off some dust. He walked forward, as if nothing had happened. His swipe was so fast for the eye that he couldn\u2019t see it and he took advantage of it and swiped off the brutes head along with the dust on his shoulder.</p> <p>Vera came down gliding and landed on the ground and bowed to his master.</p> <p>\u201cOur business here is done. Let\u2019s just take the \u2018stuff\u2019 and leave.\u201d he said as he cracked his knuckles.</p> <p>\u201cYes master.\u201d Vera said and looked over what had happened here, he took down more than five hundred people in a matter of minutes.</p> <p>\u201cOh, I forgot, I have a meeting so\u2026 can I leave the work to you?\u201d He asked Vera as he examined his surroundings.</p> <p>\u201cYes master.\u201d Just as Vera said that he had disappeared, again without any trace except some dust particles. Incredible\u2026 Vera thought as he recalled the experience from before. As expected of the Extrenof lineage...</p> <p>He looked around, in the middle of the corpses he spotted a door.</p> <p>After some time he reached the door. He entered into a dimly lot room, there was a single glass container in the middle of the room with a strange orangutan-red colored fruit in it.</p> <p>He clenched his fist and punched through the glass and it broke, he picked up the fruit and started examining it. I wonder how powerful master will become after eating this\u2026</p> <p>\u201cSo\u2026 what happened?\u201d the Ambassador asked.</p> <p>\u201cWe can talk about it, take a seat\u201d an old man poured a drink on a glass cup.</p> <p>The Ambassador sat across the old man in a sofa.</p> <p>\u201cThere\u2019s something I need help for\u2026\u201d the old man said and gave him a glass of wine.</p> <p>\u201cWhat do you need me to do?\u201d He asked as he sipped his drink.</p> <p>\u201cI\u2019m holding a feast?\u201d The old man said as he looked out of the window.</p> <p>He nodded as he looked outside the window too. There was shouting outside, people ran here and there in a panic.</p> <p>\u201cRun! The Toxins are here!\u201d Someone shouted.</p> <p>\u201cA lot of ruckus considering it\u2019s still 3 a.m\u2026\u201d the old man said, \u201cI want you to gather everyone you know for this feast\u2026\u201d he said.</p> <p>\u201cBut why though?\u201d The Ambassador asked.</p> <p>\u201cCause\u2019 it\u2019s my grandsons 10th birthday!\u201d The old man said as he smiled.</p> <p>\u201cOn it pops. WAIT WHAT GRANDSON?!\u201d</p>"}]}

Why wouldn\u2019t they? After all, the devil had come to reap their lives.</p> <p>\u201cEveryone don\u2019t let your guard down!\u201d A mercenary shouted But looking at the crowd they probably didn\u2019t give a shit about that. They just wanted to kill the man in front of them who had the bounty of 5 million.</p> <p>Not that they could though, because the in front of them was no ordinary man, you can tell by his 5 million bounty, he was no average Joe, heck his head probably had even more worth than that.</p> <p>\u201cDo they seriously think they can take me on with these numbers?\u201d A shadowy figure said in deep monotonous voice while standing at a pile of bodies.</p> <p>\u201cThey are fools master, they think that they can scratch the great Ambassador with just 500 people\u201d a robot bowed with his head down to the shadowy figure.</p> <p>\u201cThey indeed are\u2026\u201d he had an emotionless face, he showed no concern for what was happening around him.</p> <p>\u201cGive me the \u2018stuff\u2019\u201d he said as he reached his hand forward, \u201cHere, master\u201d a compartment in the robots chest opened, there was a plastic bag in it. He handed the bag with both his arms to the hand.</p> <p>He picked up the bag and opened it, he took out the stuff inside it and started eating it.</p> <p>\u201cMm\u2026 Vera, you never disappoint, your chips are top-notch in terms for seasoning\u201d he kept eating while looking at his surroundings as if he was seeing a movie.</p> <p>\u201cI\u2019m not worthy of such praise master...\u201d Vera modestly turned down his praise.</p> <p>\u201cThe hell is he doing?!\u201d Someone shouted from below.</p> <p>\u201cThey\u2019d better not start making noise all of a sudden when I\u2019m relaxing\u2026\u201d he said as he kept munching down on his chips.</p> <p>It\u2019s such a hassle when people come shouting at you when you\u2019re eating, such a pain in the ass\u2026 he thought, this wasn\u2019t the first time something like this happening to him. He encountered these type of incidents pretty often.</p> <p>\u201cHey, wannabe devil come down here so we can kick ya\u2019 ass!\u201d Another shout came from below.</p> <p>\u201cMy, they\u2019re now badmouthing me\u2026\u201d he said, without his expression changing he still kept eating chips as he analyzed the environment.</p> <p>\u201cMaster, should I take care of them?\u201d  Vera asked while looking down.</p> <p>\u201cNo need. You just enjoy the show\u2026\u201d he gave his tasty bag o\u2019 chips to Vera and jumped down.</p> <p>\u201cUm\u2026 was that really necessary?\u201d Vera questioned as he went down.</p> <p>The answer was that it wasn\u2019t, he just did it to look cool.</p> <p>\u201cHey! Can\u2019t you guys see I\u2019m eating!\u201d He shouted as he landed on the floor.</p> <p>\u201cEVERYONE CHARGE!\u201d A brute came behind from the crowd and started running towards him.</p> <p>\u201cEh\u2026 so you won\u2019t listen to my backstory? No helping it then\u201d he said in a disappointed voice.</p> <p>Everyone charged at him with killing intent, but that didn\u2019t change anything, he was already the winner.</p> <p>The Ambassador put his hand on his face and shifted his bottom part of the palm down revealing this left eye between his thumb and index finger.</p> <p>\u201cDOMINION!\u201d he shouted, his pupils and hair turned golden.</p> <p>\u201cDON\u2019T FALTER!\u201d The brute shouted as he marched forward with increasing speed.</p> <p>\u201cFISSION!\u201d He turned into disappeared, no trace of him except dust particles.</p> <p>\u201cHuh?\u201d The brute was dumbfounded, he looked desperately around to find him. Damn it! Where did that coward run off to?! The brute thought, but the man didn\u2019t run away he had actually turned into subatomic particles because of his speed.</p> <p>When the brute looked behind everyone was lying on the flood. \u201cH-How?!\u201d He grit his teeth. \u201cShow yourself coward!\u201d He shouted.</p> <p>\u201cGeez\u2026 can\u2019t you be a little less louder\u2026\u201d the man said as he came back into being as dust particles gathered.</p> <p>\u201cI\u2019LL KILL YOU!\u201d The brute leaped forward. But the man did nothing he brought up his hand to his left shoulder and swiped off some dust. He walked forward, as if nothing had happened. His swipe was so fast for the eye that he couldn\u2019t see it and he took advantage of it and swiped off the brutes head along with the dust on his shoulder.</p> <p>Vera came down gliding and landed on the ground and bowed to his master.</p> <p>\u201cOur business here is done. Let\u2019s just take the \u2018stuff\u2019 and leave.\u201d he said as he cracked his knuckles.</p> <p>\u201cYes master.\u201d Vera said and looked over what had happened here, he took down more than five hundred people in a matter of minutes.</p> <p>\u201cOh, I forgot, I have a meeting so\u2026 can I leave the work to you?\u201d He asked Vera as he examined his surroundings.</p> <p>\u201cYes master.\u201d Just as Vera said that he had disappeared, again without any trace except some dust particles. Incredible\u2026 Vera thought as he recalled the experience from before. As expected of the Extrenof lineage...</p> <p>He looked around, in the middle of the corpses he spotted a door.</p> <p>After some time he reached the door. He entered into a dimly lot room, there was a single glass container in the middle of the room with a strange orangutan-red colored fruit in it.</p> <p>He clenched his fist and punched through the glass and it broke, he picked up the fruit and started examining it. I wonder how powerful master will become after eating this\u2026</p> <p></p> <p>\u201cSo\u2026 what happened?\u201d the Ambassador asked.</p> <p>\u201cWe can talk about it, take a seat\u201d an old man poured a drink on a glass cup.</p> <p>The Ambassador sat across the old man in a sofa.</p> <p>\u201cThere\u2019s something I need help for\u2026\u201d the old man said and gave him a glass of wine.</p> <p>\u201cWhat do you need me to do?\u201d He asked as he sipped his drink.</p> <p>\u201cI\u2019m holding a feast.\u201d The old man said as he looked out of the window.</p> <p>He nodded as he looked outside the window too. There was shouting outside, people ran here and there in a panic.</p> <p>\u201cRun! The Toxins are here!\u201d Someone shouted.</p> <p>\u201cA lot of ruckus considering it\u2019s still 3 a.m\u2026\u201d the old man said, \u201cI want you to gather everyone you know for this feast\u2026\u201d he said.</p> <p>\u201cBut why though?\u201d The Ambassador asked.</p> <p>\u201cCause\u2019 it\u2019s my grandsons 10th birthday!\u201d The old man said as he smiled.</p> <p>\u201cOn it pops.

He\u2019s sleeping early\u2026 she thought. She walked over to the other side of the bed and looked over at Aces\u2019 face which was covered by the blanket. She looked at him for a while and after some time she left while closing the door carefully.

She stared at me for some time and then her face broke into a smile.</p> <p>\u201cYou\u2019re so clumsy!\u201d She poked my cheek.</p> <p>I smiled and said,  \u201cCan\u2019t help it\u2026\u201d</p> <p>\u201cIt\u2019s 10:00 a.m go and brush your teeth, we\u2019ll have breakfast somewhere special.\u201d She said.</p> <p>Ahh\u2026 such a cute sister\u2026 WAIT WHAT 10:00 a.m?!</p> <p>I jumped out of my bed and dashed outside the room.</p> <p>Such a clumsy brother... I thought.</p> <p></p> <p>Oh no, no\u2026 I got up late!</p> <p>I dashed into the bathroom and in a second I was brushing my teeth as fast as I could.</p> <p>Wait\u2026 how did she enter my room?</p> <p>I put water into my mouth, gargled and spit it out, and ran towards my room at full speed, also to brag a bit, I had a reasonably high-speed stat, enough to go into nationals maybe\u2026 But that doesn\u2019t matter, I\u2019m not interested in it anyway, what does matter is where would they take me today? Maybe a family restaurant? No, a bit too clich\u00e9 for my parents, well I\u2019ll just stop guessing for now, I want to maintain the \u2018surprise\u2019 element for the surprise they have for me.</p> <p>I ran into my room picked out the clothes that were the most close to me and changed.</p> <p>I saw myself in the mirror and I looked pretty good to be honest, I was always surprised by the luck I had when it came to fashion sense. I bet all people who have the \u2018no-fashion-sense\u2019 trait will be burning from jealously.</p> <p>Speaking of \u2018luck\u2019, a lot of things have been pretty peaceful in my life for quite some time, except the bullying, uhm\u2026 a lot more, maybe?</p> <p>\u201cC\u2019mon already! How much time you gonna take?!\u201d Lyla raised her voice from outside.</p> <p>\u201cJust a second!\u201d I also raised my voice from inside.</p> <p>I quickly ran towards the door and opened it swiftly in excitement, and there she was, my angelic sister in her angelic clothes\u2026 </p> <p>I bet my sister complex is greater than any anime onii-san</p> <p>I shook my head and stepped out of my room careful to not look at my sister\u2019s brilliance which could blind me eternally.</p> <p>\u201cYou\u2019re acting weird\u2026\u201d She said in a curious voice.</p> <p>\u201cI\u2019m always weird.\u201d I replied as I ran down downstairs, she followed behind me.</p> <p>\u201cBut this time you\u2019re like weird weird,\u201d she said as she looked at me but suspicion.</p> <p>\u201cMaybe I\u2019m just a little too excited right now...\u201d I said as we reached the bottom floor.</p> <p>I was instantly greeted by my brother Sam who was grabbing heaps of cheese balls out of a bag of Cheezos and shoving it inside his mouth.</p> <p>\u201cHapwe Bwarthdwe!\u201d He mumbled out as he kept eating.</p> <p>Lyla walked over to him climbed up the chair and smacked Sam\u2019s head.</p> <p>Oof\u2026</p> <p>I walked near them picked Lyla from the chair and put her down.</p> <p>\u201cYou shouldn\u2019t just smack someone when you\u2019re eating\u2026\u201d I crouched and said to her.</p> <p>\u201cBut it\u2019s your birthday and he couldn\u2019t even give you a proper greeting!\u201d She pouted as she said.</p> <p>She did that for me! [sparkling face effect]</p> <p>I picked her up and put her back on the chair.</p> <p>\u201cIt\u2019s fine\u2026\u201d I said smugly and walked towards the kitchen.</p> <p>\u201cCough- Where are mom and dad?\u201d Sam asked as he swallowed the last of his Cheetos.</p> <p>\u201cI don\u2019t know maybe they went to get stuff ready\u2026\u201d I poured myself a drink from the fridge and drank it all in one go.</p> <p>\u201cYou should get friends y\u2019know\u2026\u201d Sam said in a low voice.</p> <p>Emotional damage...</p> <p>\u201cI don\u2019t need them, I\u2019m fine on my own,\u201d I replied sharply.</p> <p>\u201cHuh? You heard that?\u201d</p> <p>\u201cYou forgot? He has superhuman abilities\u2026\u201d Lyla said as she climbed down the chair.</p> <p>Just genetics playing their part...</p> <p>I screamed in my mind to shake off the emotional damage and sighed.</p> <p>\u201cI don\u2019t need friends, I\u2019m fine with both of you\u2026\u201d I mumbled.</p> <p>\u201cNo, you can\u2019t be, you need to get friends!\u201d They both said at the same time.</p> <p>\u201cAnd you call me superhuman\u2026\u201d I replied as I smiled.</p> <p>\u201cThe ride\u2019s here!\u201d A loud voice came from outside.</p> <p>\u201cDad\u2019s here\u2026\u201d Lyla said in an unsurprising voice.</p> <p>Shouldn\u2019t daughters be more excited when their dad comes home?</p> <p>\u201cLet\u2019s go!\u201d Sam sprang up from the chair and ran towards the front door.</p> <p>\u201cThere\u2019ll also be food there!\u201d I shouted as I grabbed Lyla and walked outside.</p> <p>\u201cThis isn\u2019t about food!\u201d Sam yelled back.</p> <p></p> <p>It took about 2 hours to complete the trip from home to the place we were visiting.</p> <p>After getting out of the van, I instantly got super excited because there was a large mall-like building in front of us with food stalls surrounding the whole building leaving space for the road. And the most important part, the was a large sign on top of the building that said \u201cSCIENCE EXHIBIT\u201d.</p> <p>I can finally meet with fellow nerds and talk about physics, chemistry, and biology what not, all day long...</p> <p>\u201cWhipeee!\u201d I yelled as I made a beeline towards the main gate.</p> <p>\u201cHey wait! Dad said that we should stick together!\u201d Sam and Lyla came running from behind.</p> <p>Okay, okay, I know you\u2019re excited but don\u2019t forget big brother responsibility\u2026</p> <p>\u201cOops, sorry\u2026\u201d I apologized and looked again at the building.</p> <p>\u201cIt\u2019s huge\u2026\u201d Lyla said as she looked up and down to examine the building.</p> <p>\u201cIt\u2026is, will there be food on the upper floors too?\u201d Sam asked as he also looked up at the building.</p> <p>\u201cDon\u2019t know\u2026 We\u2019ll have to find out!\u201d I lifted my foot to start running but I put my foot back down.</p> <p>\u201cWhat happened?\u201d Lyla asked as she ran towards me and tucked my hand.</p> <p>\u201cLet\u2019s go eat something first\u2026\u201d I said as my stomach cried in the background.</p> <p>\u201cYippeee! I\u2019ll go get corn dogs!\u201d Sam got excited and started walking towards the stalls.</p> <p>I grabbed him by the collar and pulled him towards me.</p> <p>\u201cWait a second, we need to stay together,\u201d I said as I started walking towards one of the stalls.</p> <p>\u201cBut you ran away like me earlier\u2026\u201d Sam said as his stomach also cried in the background.</p> <p>\u201cI learned from my mistakes\u2026\u201d</p> <p>Another sound came from behind, someone else\u2019s stomach was also crying. We both looked behind and we saw our little sister holding her stomach.</p> <p>\u201cHungry...\u201d she said in a low voice.</p> <p>O\u2019 god of science I don\u2019t deserve such brilliance emitting from this angel\u2026</p> <p>We eventually found a stall that sold corn dogs, although I had a hard time getting through the crowd that kept pushing, but it was all worth it, the corn dogs were some high-quality stuff and I ended up buying them a second time.</p> <p>\u201cSo good~,\u201d She said as she ate through the corn dog.</p> <p>But the corn dog itself wasn\u2019t why I didn\u2019t repurchase them, it was so that me and my brother could watch our cute little sister gradually and delicately yet very cutely eat the corn dog.</p> <p>But we can\u2019t spend all our money, we need to save some to eat when we get out of the exhibit.</p> <p>We all put our corn dogs in our stomachs for digestion and started walking towards the exhibit, the main attraction, my source of excitement.</p> <p>\u201cI\u2019ve never seen you so pumped before,\u201d Sam said as he leaned forward and looked at me.</p> <p>\u201cHe looks pretty funny!\u201d Lyla said as she also leaned forward.</p> <p>\u201cYou think so? That\u2019s cause\u2019 I\u2019m excited! I can finally see stuff I want to and am excited about.\u201d I blurted out.</p> <p>We reached the building\u2019s main entrance and entered the building.</p> <p>It was like a whole new environment inside, people with white lab coats walked here and there demonstrating different experiments and projects to science enthusiasts. I randomly picked a scientist and walked towards the experiment he was performing.</p> <p>The scientist was showing some type of miniature nuclear reactor to everyone.</p> <p>\u201c-We bring these tiny particles super close together and make them join. When they do, they release a lot of energy, like a big power-up in a video game. This energy is what we use to generate electricity. Unlike some other ways we make energy, fusion doesn\u2019t create harmful stuff, making it a cool and clean way to power things!\u201d Everyone clapped and dispersed in different directions.</p> <p>It wasn\u2019t anything new, although the way he explained was very good. I can see students liking him.</p> <p>I began looking around to find something interesting.</p> <p>\u201cWhat happened?\u201d Sam asked as he also began looking around.</p> <p>\u201cTrying to find something interesting\u2026\u201d I replied as I looked left, right, and backward.</p> <p>\u201cWhat about that?\u201d Lyla said as she tucked my hand and pointed to a small room on the other side.</p> <p>There was a yellow sign on top of the roof. \u201cT.E Serum,\u201d it said.</p> <p>\u201cWay to go sister, you found something interesting,\u201d I said as I concealed my excitement and walked towards the room.</p> <p>Just when we reached the door a tall figure came leaning out of the door.</p> <p>\u201cWhat may I do for you, sir?\u201d He said in a monotonous voice.</p> <p>Chilling vibes\u2026</p> <p>\u201cJust\u2026 came to see what they were showing here\u2026\u201d I replied as I stuttered.</p> <p>No, don\u2019t be scared, he\u2019s just a scientist\u2026a fellow science lover like me.</p> <p>\u201cYou\u2026 mean about T.E.?\u201d There was a hint of surprise in his face.</p> <p>\u201cUh, yes\u2026\u201d I straightened my back as I said that.</p> <p>\u201cWell, then you\u2019re welcome, young man\u2026\u201d he smiled as he moved out of the way and gestured for me to go inside.</p> <p>I looked back to see my brother and sister and gestured for them to go inside.</p> <p>We went in and the scientist followed us from behind.</p> <p>Now, don\u2019t kidnap us\u2026</p> <p>The room was small there was a glass tank in the middle which was attached to what looked like a terminal with many buttons.</p> <p>\u201cGo near the tank I\u2019ll show you something interesting...\u201d he said and walked towards the terminal. I went near the tank with my siblings and examined what was inside.</p> <p>It looked like a desert terrarium, there was a hollow wood log in the center and a small glass plate outside one of the ends.</p> <p>\u201cNow watch closely\u2026\u201d he said as he pushed one of the buttons of the buttons on the terminal.</p> <p>A small hole opened up in the sand and a small robotic arm that held a piece of paper came out.</p> <p>\u201cWoah\u2026\u201d Sam and Lyla looked at it in awe.</p> <p>The robotic arm put the piece of paper on the plate and then went back into the hole and disappeared.</p> <p>When I examined the paper I saw there was something written in it.</p> <p>&lt;45x = 360&gt;</p> <p>It was a math question.</p> <p>What does he want to do?</p> <p>\u201cAlgebra?\u201d I said as I looked at the paper, confused.</p> <p>\u201cJust wait\u2026\u201d I said as he pushed another button on the terminal.</p> <p>A lizard came out of the hollow log, he looked at the piece of paper and went back into the log, soon he came back holding a small pencil, but something was different.</p> <p>\u201cHow did he turn blue\u2026\u201d I asked as I looked at the lizard.</p> <p>The lizard began scribbling on the paper and then went back into the log. Another button was pushed and a hole opened up in the tank. The scientist picked up the piece of paper through the hole and the hole closed up.</p> <p>\u201cLook at this, is this correct?\u201d He asked as he handed the paper to me.</p> <p>&lt;45x = 360 x = 360/45 x = 8&gt;</p> <p>\u201cHe solved it? He solved algebra?!\u201d I said as my hands shook in excitement. \u201cWhat did you do?\u201d I asked as I looked at the paper in amazement.</p> <p>\u201cYou look happy, this is the ability of T.E serum, it makes even the stupidest of creatures very smart and-\u201d</p> <p>As he was speaking the ground shook very badly and the glass tank broke, the concrete began cracking up and made creaking sounds.</p> <p>\u201cRun!\u201d The scientist pushed the three of us outside and closed the door from behind.</p> <p>\u201cWhat\u2019s happening?!\u201d Sam yelled as he and Lyla grabbed me.</p> <p>\u201cDon\u2019t worry! Just run!\u201d We all began running towards the main entrance.</p> <p>A huge boulder fell from above blocking the main entrance, then the ground began shaking much faster. Another boulder fell from above, this time directly above us. I lost my balance and fell forwards pulling my siblings away from the boulders trajectory. The boulder landed and made a huge hole in the ground, the ground surrounding the hole began to break and soon we all fell into the hole.</p> <p>\u201cAHHHH!\u201d everyone shouted as they went through free fall, we weren\u2019t alone, many people fell with us. That wasn\u2019t the problem.</p> <p>I grabbed both of my siblings mid-air and turned my back towards the ground and kept my siblings above me.</p> <p>\u201cBRACE YOURSELVES!\u201d I shouted as we continued to close the gap between us and the ground.</p> <p>My siblings grasped my body very hard, I couldn\u2019t do anything else, I was dying, or would be dying. It didn\u2019t matter, as long as Sam and Lyla lived. I hugged them both one last time as I hit the ground below, only a moment to think was left before I lost consciousness.</p> <p>Man, the day I was supposed to enjoy the most was ruined\u2026 if heaven is real, then dear god, you\u2019d better repent on your actions, screw you\u2026</p> <p></p> <p>\u201cUgh\u2026\u201d I groaned as I tried to get up. I couldn\u2019t, something wasn\u2019t letting me.</p> <p>I tried to face up, but I couldn\u2019t. After struggling for a bit, I was able to see what was blocking me. It was a block of concrete.</p> <p>A block of concrete fell on me? How the hell am I alive?! I began panicking and tried to find an opening. Soon enough I found a hole, a small one. Fortunately, I could remove some small rocks, move them outside, and make the hole wider to escape.</p> <p>\u201cGODDAMMIT! WHY WONT\u2019CHA LEAVE ME ALONE!\u201d Someone yelled from outside.</p> <p>What\u2019s happening outside?!</p> <p>I quickly removed some rocks near the hole to make it wide enough to see through.</p> <p>\u201cFINE! IF YOU WON\u2019T I\u2019LL KILL EVERYBODY! GYAHAHAHAH!\u201d He let out a murderous laugh.</p> <p>I positioned my head near the hole so I could see what was happening outside. I saw a skinny man with a jet-pack-like thing attached to his back, he was laughing maniacally as robotic arms came out from his jet pack and threw boulders forward. I struggled to move my head closer to the hole to get a better view. There were three people, moving forward dodging all the boulders the madman threw at them.</p> <p>\u201cHEY! STOP THIS YOU PIECE OF-\u201d A guy got hit by a boulder and was sent flying towards me as he was shouting.</p> <p>What\u2026</p> <p>I simply lied there. Trying to understand stuff incomprehensible to me, trying to think.</p> <p>What do I\u2026do\u2026</p> <p>The other two people scrambled their way to the fallen guy trying to help him up, then suddenly they leapt and ran away. There was a boulder coming straight at me. I braced for the impact to minimize damage, but why was I minimizing damage? I should\u2019ve been dead.</p> <p>The boulder hit me, and it hurt, but the concrete block that was not letting me move was shattered. I was free.</p> <p>I struggled to move out of the debris, then I caught something in my peripheral vision. Two dead bodies lying on the floor. I struggled my way out of the debris, all my muscles were sore, and it hurt like hell. But I didn\u2019t stop. I couldn\u2019t stop.</p> <p>\u201cTHERE\u2019S A KID HERE!\u201d A woman shouted, but I couldn\u2019t care less.</p> <p>Shut up or the madman will look at me...</p> <p>I gathered all the energy I had in my body and ran all I could towards the dead bodies.</p> <p>\u201cHEY KID! GET A TASTE OF THIS BOULDER! GYAHAHAH!\u201d</p> <p>Crap...</p> <p>I panicked as I looked to my left, there was a large block of concrete flying towards me. I quickly leapt forward, dodged the boulder, and landed near the two dead bodies.</p> <p>\u201cGET AWAY!\u201d Someone shouted, but I didn\u2019t listen.</p> <p>Tears rolled down my eyes as I looked at the two corpses in front of me. The corpses of Lyla and Sam.</p> <p>NO! NO, NO, NO, NO\u2026 PLEASE NO!</p> <p>I quickly put my hand on the left side of their chests and checked their pulse. No beat. They weren\u2019t breathing. They\u2019re dead.</p> <p>Why\u2026</p> <p>I hugged the corpses tightly, not believing that they were dead.</p> <p>Why\u2026 don\u2019t die on me!</p> <p>\u201cNO USE THEY\u2019RE ALL DEAD! YOUR FAMILY, FRIENDS BLAH BLAH BLAH! I DON\u2019T CARE! THEY\u2019RE ALL DEAD! GYAHAHAH!\u201d He shouted.</p> <p>What\u2026 what enjoyment do you\u2026 get out of this huh? Do you\u2026 think this is funny?! You-</p> <p>I shouted in my mind as a stream of water rolled down my cheeks.</p> <p>Krkkk!</p> <p>Something fell on my head. It felt like glass, my head felt watery. It hurt, hurt real bad.</p> <p>\u201cWHY?!\u201d I shouted as anger welled up inside me.</p> <p>I experienced a tingling sensation in my head and suddenly my body seemed like it was a size bigger. It felt like my intelligence was fading away.</p> <p>\"WHAT HAPPENED TO HIM?!\" Someone shouted.</p> <p></p> <p>Shiroko Koneko panicked as she saw the boy\u2019s muscles got bigger.</p> <p>\u201cUm\u2026 What happened to him?!\u201d I shouted as I looked at Jeremy.</p> <p>\u201cI don\u2019t know! Something fell on him and then his body suddenly got bigger!\u201d</p> <p>\u201cEither way it\u2019s bad news!\u201d Captain Jim shouted.</p> <p>The boy got up putting aside the corpses of what seemed like his family.</p> <p>\u201cWhat\u2019s he\u2026 doing?\u201d Becky came from behind panting heavily.</p> <p>The boy turned towards the madman. His eyes pure red, his pupils white. There was pure rage in his eyes. His hair turned crimson.</p> <p>A chill ran down Shiroko\u2019s spine as the boy started walking towards the madman.</p> <p>\u201cI\u2026 got a bad feeling-\u201d Just as she was talking the boy suddenly vanished.</p> <p>\u201cWha- where did he go?\u201d Everyone began to look for him.</p> <p>Then they all saw the madman on the floor. Getting heavy punches drilled into him with every punch created a loud sound.</p> <p>\u201cSTOP HIM HE\u2019S GONNA KILL HIM!\u201d Jim ordered and everyone ran towards the boy.</p> <p>Every second a large thud concealed the area.</p> <p>Is he trying to kill him?!</p> <p>Everyone ran towards the boy.She panicked and grabbed the boys arm and the boy stopped.</p> <p>I did it!</p> <p>The boy turned around and looked at Shiroko.</p> <p>Eep! Scary!</p> <p>The boy looked back at the madman and continued beating him.</p> <p>It\u2019s not working?!</p> <p>Everyone grabbed the boys right arm which was now covered with blood.</p> <p>But the boy continued beating him with his left arm.</p> <p>\u201cNO USE! PULL HIM ASIDE!\u201d Jim ordered and everyone grabbed the boys body and tried to him back.</p> <p>The boy stopped and then began moving away.</p> <p>\u201cIt\u2019s working\u2026\u201d</p> <p>The boy vanished again and appeared on top of the madman.</p> <p>\u201cCRAP IT ISN\u2019T!\u201d</p> <p>She ran back to him grabbed him again, more like a hug from behind.</p> <p>\u201cSTOP IT!\u201d She yelled. He didn\u2019t stop.</p> <p>\u201cDON\u2019T DO THIS!\u201d He didn\u2019t listen.</p> <p>\u201cKILLING WON\u2019T DO ANYTHING!\u201d She yelled with all her might.</p> <p>The thud sounds got nullified. It was pure silence now.</p> <p>I\u2026 did it\u2026</p> <p>Everyone came from behind and grabbed the boy and took him behind.</p> <p>\u201cLet\u2019s go, our work here is done.\u201d Jim said as he grabbed hold of the boy.</p> <p>He\u2026 almost killed him. He got angry.</p> <p>She looked at the madman\u2019s face.</p> <p>\u201cAH!\u201d She screamed.</p> <p>\u201cDid something happen!\u201d Jim asked as he looked back.</p> <p>\u201cN-nothing!\u201d She shouted back.</p> <p>The madman\u2019s face was now the disoriented and deformed form of what it was before.</p> <p>His face\u2026</p>"}]}

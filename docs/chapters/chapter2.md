# Chapter 2: T.E
I completed my breakfast and headed straight to my room as fast as I could. I opened the door and jumped on my bed, then planted my face on the pillow.

“Why me…” I mumbled out.
No use thinking about it. What was done was done. I lost my family. I failed to protect them. I failed to do everything.
Even my parents, they also died in the exhibit incident when they were coming to pick us up.
All that was left, was just a lone survivor who didn’t know what to do.
Stop thinking…
I had been given two choice today morning. Whether I wanted to stay with them and help protect people or go to the orphanage.
I picked the first option, and I promised myself that I won’t let what happened to me happen to anyone else. Whether I could do it or not, I didn’t know.
“Ugh…” I groaned as I removed my face from the pillow.
No use thinking about it…
I need to focus on what I can do now. That was helping these people, from what I learnt. They also had ‘powers’ like me.
But I didn’t know how to control my powers.
That’s it!
My first step. Learn to control my powers. Now I just need to forge a step-by-step plan to learn how to control my powers.
I got up and took out a pen and a diary from my drawer and started jotting some stuff down.
<T.E

How do I use it…
I began brainstorming.

“You think he’s okay?” Becky asked as she got up from the table.
“Maybe, last time I checked, he just wanted to know what he can do.” Jim replied as he ate the last of his salad.
“Huh?”
“He said that he feels there is something that he needs to do, but he doesn’t know what it is.” Jim got up and went towards the sofa.
“He… isn’t worried about his family?” Becky asked in a surprised voice.
“No, he didn’t mention anything about that…” Jim said as he laid back on the sofa.
“Strange…”

I couldn’t think in my room so I went to the kitchen, living area and at last the roof.
What should be the first step…
But it still didn’t help.
“Aw man…” I put my hand on the head and just sat down and laid my back towards the railing.
Looks like I have to wait before I experience my powers again.
Now it all comes to time. At worst, it could take 5 years and I still wouldn’t be able to control my powers.
No… don’t think about worst…
I closed my eyes and looked up in the sky.
Stay patient. Gain experience overtime… experience? That’s it.
I quickly opened my diary and started writing.
<T.E
Ability: allows the user to physically or mentally enhance themselves
How to use: 
Step 1: Remember the experience form the first time.
Step 2: Remember the feeling it gave.
Step 3: Replicate that feeling.>
Now I had something to work with. First, I needed to remember the first time I used this power. Second, I needed to know what feeling it gave. Third, I had to replicate that feeling to activate my powers.
But the problem was that I didn’t remember anything after I saw both of my siblings dead.
Dead…
No use. I’ll think about it later. I need go get some sleep.
I got up and walked towards the stairs.
“Ow!” Someone came running at me and fell over me.
“Aw man…” he said.
“What did you do?!” A girl said as she tried to pick me up.
“You can only pick me up if he got up from me.” I replied.
“Oops, sorry dude.” He apologized as he got up.
“No problem…” I got up and dusted myself.
“Are you okay?” The girl asked.
I looked at her. Her hair was white and beautiful.
“Yes.” I shook my head.
“Really?” She asked again.
Wow, she’s persistent…
“Yes. Really.” I said again.
She circled around me and looked at me from different angles.
“You have a cut on your right leg…” She said at last.
I turned my right leg and looked at it, there was a inch long cut there.
“Oh. It’s fine.” I said.
“You should go and treat it.” she didn’t listen.
“But I’m fine…” I tried to to get away from this situation.
“It’s a long cut, you might get infections.” She said in a cold voice.
She grabbed my hand tightly and then dragged me to the living room.
“What happened?” Becky asked.
“He got a cut.” She said.
Oof…


“Okay, all done.” She finished applying band-aid to me.
“What happened to him?” She said the girl.
“Jeremy ran over him.” She said.
They both looked at Jeremy who was now whimpering in a corner.
I feel sympathy…
“It’s not his fault, I didn’t look forward.” I said.
Now they both looked at me.
Was that the right call?

# Chapter 1: "That Day"

It’s been two years since I moved from India to New York, and there have been many difficulties… like communication problems, cultural differences, etc etc… But I don’t care. I’m having fun with my little brother and sister and that’s all I want.

And it’s April 18 today! My birthday! I’ve been thinking about it the whole day and I can’t stop thinking about it, heck, I even skipped my study sessions today because of that… Who cares, I’m smart enough anyway…

“Ace! You asleep yet?!” A shout came from downstairs.

*Mom’s coming!*

I quickly turned off the light and covered my face with the blanket. *Hot! I have put up with it for a while.*

After some time the door made a creaking sound.

“We have to oil the door…” Ace’s mom said and glanced at Ace.
*He’s sleeping early…* she thought.
She walked over to the other side of the bed and looked over at Aces’ face which was covered by the blanket. She looked at him for a while and after some time she left while closing the door carefully.
She left…

*Hehe… Paneer… So tasty… GIMME MORE!*

“Brother!” A little girl shouted.

*Cake… Mm.*

“Wake up!” She shouted again.

*Lyla…*

“BROTHER WAKE UP!” She shouted.

Ace got up swiftly and looked around but he couldn’t see anything.

*Blurry...*

The little girl picked up spectacles from the table beside the bed and thrusted it into Aces’ eyes.

“Ow! ow… That hurt…” He grimaced.

I saw a little girl with brownish hair in front of me with a frown on her face. She stared at me for some time and then her face broke into a smile.

“You’re so clumsy!” She poked my cheek.

I smiled and said,  “Can’t help it…”

“It’s 10:00 a.m go and brush your teeth, we’ll have breakfast somewhere special.” She said.

*Ahh… such a cute sister… WAIT WHAT 10:00 a.m?!*

I jumped out of my bed and dashed outside the room.

*Such a clumsy brother...* I thought.

![scene break](assets/scene.png)

*Oh no, no… I got up late!*

I dashed into the bathroom and in a second I was brushing my teeth as fast as I could.

*Wait… how did she enter my room?*

I put water into my mouth, gargled and spit it out, and ran towards my room at full speed, also to brag a bit, I had a reasonably high-speed stat, enough to go into nationals maybe… But that doesn’t matter, I’m not interested in it anyway, what does matter is where would they take me today? Maybe a family restaurant? No, a bit too cliché for my parents, well I’ll just stop guessing for now, I want to maintain the ‘surprise’ element for the surprise they have for me.

I ran into my room picked out the clothes that were the most close to me and changed.

I saw myself in the mirror and I looked pretty good to be honest, I was always surprised by the luck I had when it came to fashion sense. I bet all people who have the ‘no-fashion-sense’ trait will be burning from jealously.

Speaking of ‘luck’, a lot of things have been pretty peaceful in my life for quite some time, except the bullying, uhm… a lot more, maybe?

“C’mon already! How much time you gonna take?!” Lyla raised her voice from outside.

“Just a second!” I also raised my voice from inside.

I quickly ran towards the door and opened it swiftly in excitement, and there she was, my angelic sister in her angelic clothes… 

*I bet my sister complex is greater than any anime [onii-san](http://www.romajidesu.com/dictionary/meaning-of-oniisan.html)*

I shook my head and stepped out of my room careful to not look at my sister’s brilliance which could blind me eternally.

“You’re acting weird…” She said in a curious voice.

“I’m always weird.” I replied as I ran down downstairs, she followed behind me.

“But this time you’re like *weird* weird,” she said as she looked at me but suspicion.

“Maybe I’m just a little too excited right now...” I said as we reached the bottom floor.

I was instantly greeted by my brother Sam who was grabbing heaps of cheese balls out of a bag of Cheezos and shoving it inside his mouth.

“*Hapwe Bwarthdwe!*” He mumbled out as he kept eating.

Lyla walked over to him climbed up the chair and smacked Sam’s head.

*Oof…*

I walked near them picked Lyla from the chair and put her down.

“You shouldn’t just smack someone when you’re eating…” I crouched and said to her.

“But it’s your birthday and he couldn’t even give you a proper greeting!” She pouted as she said.

*She did that for me! [sparkling face effect]*

I picked her up and put her back on the chair.

“It’s fine…” I said smugly and walked towards the kitchen.

“*Cough-* Where are mom and dad?” Sam asked as he swallowed the last of his Cheetos.

“I don’t know maybe they went to get stuff ready…” I poured myself a drink from the fridge and drank it all in one go.

“You should get friends y’know…” Sam said in a low voice.

*[Emotional damage...](https://www.google.com/imgres?q=emotional%20damage&imgurl=https%3A%2F%2Fuploads.dailydot.com%2F2023%2F11%2Femotional-damage-meme.jpg%3Fauto%3Dcompress%26fm%3Dpjpg&imgrefurl=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.dailydot.com%2Fnews%2Femotional-damage-meme%2F&docid=n0YvfSNj3d5PhM&tbnid=Z9ZWDvxr4NYsZM&vet=12ahUKEwjG_La3_62GAxWXTWcHHbH0CbAQM3oECHMQAA..i&w=2000&h=1000&hcb=2&ved=2ahUKEwjG_La3_62GAxWXTWcHHbH0CbAQM3oECHMQAA)*

“I don’t need them, I’m fine on my own,” I replied sharply.

“Huh? You heard that?”

“You forgot? He has superhuman abilities…” Lyla said as she climbed down the chair.

*Just genetics playing their part...*

I screamed in my mind to shake off the [emotional damage](https://www.google.com/imgres?q=emotional%20damage&imgurl=https%3A%2F%2Fuploads.dailydot.com%2F2023%2F11%2Femotional-damage-meme.jpg%3Fauto%3Dcompress%26fm%3Dpjpg&imgrefurl=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.dailydot.com%2Fnews%2Femotional-damage-meme%2F&docid=n0YvfSNj3d5PhM&tbnid=Z9ZWDvxr4NYsZM&vet=12ahUKEwjG_La3_62GAxWXTWcHHbH0CbAQM3oECHMQAA..i&w=2000&h=1000&hcb=2&ved=2ahUKEwjG_La3_62GAxWXTWcHHbH0CbAQM3oECHMQAA) and sighed.

“I don’t need friends, I’m fine with both of you…” I mumbled.

“No, you can’t be, you need to get friends!” They both said at the same time.

“And you call me superhuman…” I replied as I smiled.

“The ride’s here!” A loud voice came from outside.

“Dad’s here…” Lyla said in an unsurprising voice.

*Shouldn’t daughters be more excited when their dad comes home?*

“Let’s go!” Sam sprang up from the chair and ran towards the front door.

“There’ll also be food there!” I shouted as I grabbed Lyla and walked outside.

“This isn’t about food!” Sam yelled back.

![scene break](assets/scene.png)

It took about 2 hours to complete the trip from home to the place we were visiting.

After getting out of the van, I instantly got super excited because there was a large mall-like building in front of us with food stalls surrounding the whole building leaving space for the road. And the most important part, the was a large sign on top of the building that said “SCIENCE EXHIBIT”.

*I can finally meet with fellow nerds and talk about physics, chemistry, and biology what not, all day long...*

“Whipeee!” I yelled as I made a beeline towards the main gate.

“Hey wait! Dad said that we should stick together!” Sam and Lyla came running from behind.

*Okay, okay, I know you’re excited but don’t forget big brother responsibility…*

“Oops, sorry…” I apologized and looked again at the building.

“It’s huge…” Lyla said as she looked up and down to examine the building.

“It…is, will there be food on the upper floors too?” Sam asked as he also looked up at the building.

“Don’t know… We’ll have to find out!” I lifted my foot to start running but I put my foot back down.

“What happened?” Lyla asked as she ran towards me and tucked my hand.

“Let’s go eat something first…” I said as my stomach cried in the background.

“Yippeee! I’ll go get corn dogs!” Sam got excited and started walking towards the stalls.

I grabbed him by the collar and pulled him towards me.

“Wait a second, we need to stay together,” I said as I started walking towards one of the stalls.

“But you ran away like me earlier…” Sam said as his stomach also cried in the background.

“I learned from my mistakes…”

Another sound came from behind, someone else’s stomach was also crying. We both looked behind and we saw our little sister holding her stomach.

“Hungry...” she said in a low voice.

O’ god of science I don’t deserve such brilliance emitting from this angel…

We eventually found a stall that sold corn dogs, although I had a hard time getting through the crowd that kept pushing, but it was all worth it, the corn dogs were some high-quality stuff and I ended up buying them a second time.

“So good~,” She said as she ate through the corn dog.

But the corn dog itself wasn’t why I didn’t repurchase them, it was so that me and my brother could watch our cute little sister gradually and delicately yet very cutely eat the corn dog.

But we can’t spend all our money, we need to save some to eat when we get out of the exhibit.

We all put our corn dogs in our stomachs for digestion and started walking towards the exhibit, the main attraction, my source of excitement.

“I’ve never seen you so pumped before,” Sam said as he leaned forward and looked at me.

“He looks pretty funny!” Lyla said as she also leaned forward.

“You think so? That’s cause’ I’m excited! I can finally see stuff I want to and am excited about.” I blurted out.

We reached the building’s main entrance and entered the building.

It was like a whole new environment inside, people with white lab coats walked here and there demonstrating different experiments and projects to science enthusiasts.
I randomly picked a scientist and walked towards the experiment he was performing.

The scientist was showing some type of miniature nuclear reactor to everyone.

“-We bring these tiny particles super close together and make them join. When they do, they release a lot of energy, like a big power-up in a video game. This energy is what we use to generate electricity. Unlike some other ways we make energy, fusion doesn’t create harmful stuff, making it a cool and clean way to power things!” Everyone clapped and dispersed in different directions.

It wasn’t anything new, although the way he explained was very good. I can see students liking him.

I began looking around to find something interesting.

“What happened?” Sam asked as he also began looking around.

“Trying to find something interesting…” I replied as I looked left, right, and backward.

“What about that?” Lyla said as she tucked my hand and pointed to a small room on the other side.

There was a yellow sign on top of the roof. “T.E Serum,” it said.

“Way to go sister, you found something interesting,” I said as I concealed my excitement and walked towards the room.

Just when we reached the door a tall figure came leaning out of the door.

“What may I do for you, sir?” He said in a monotonous voice.

*Chilling vibes…*

“Just… came to see what they were showing here…” I replied as I stuttered.

*No, don’t be scared, he’s just a scientist…a fellow science lover like me.*

“You… mean about T.E.?” There was a hint of surprise in his face.

“Uh, yes…” I straightened my back as I said that.

“Well, then you’re welcome, young man…” he smiled as he moved out of the way and gestured for me to go inside.

I looked back to see my brother and sister and gestured for them to go inside.

We went in and the scientist followed us from behind.

*Now, don’t kidnap us…*

The room was small there was a glass tank in the middle which was attached to what looked like a terminal with many buttons.

“Go near the tank I’ll show you something interesting...” he said and walked towards the terminal. I went near the tank with my siblings and examined what was inside.

It looked like a desert terrarium, there was a hollow wood log in the center and a small glass plate outside one of the ends.

“Now watch closely…” he said as he pushed one of the buttons of the buttons on the terminal.

A small hole opened up in the sand and a small robotic arm that held a piece of paper came out.

“Woah…” Sam and Lyla looked at it in awe.

The robotic arm put the piece of paper on the plate and then went back into the hole and disappeared.

When I examined the paper I saw there was something written in it.

> <45x = 360>

It was a math question.

*What does he want to do?*

“Algebra?” I said as I looked at the paper, confused.

“Just wait…” I said as he pushed another button on the terminal.

A lizard came out of the hollow log, he looked at the piece of paper and went back into the log, soon he came back holding a small pencil, but something was different.

“How did he turn blue…” I asked as I looked at the lizard.

The lizard began scribbling on the paper and then went back into the log.
Another button was pushed and a hole opened up in the tank.
The scientist picked up the piece of paper through the hole and the hole closed up.

“Look at this, is this correct?” He asked as he handed the paper to me.

> <45x = 360
x = 360/45
x = 8>

“He solved it? He solved algebra?!” I said as my hands shook in excitement.
“What did you do?” I asked as I looked at the paper in amazement.

“You look happy, this is the ability of T.E serum, it makes even the stupidest of creatures very smart and-”

As he was speaking the ground shook very badly and the glass tank broke, the concrete began cracking up and made creaking sounds.

“Run!” The scientist pushed the three of us outside and closed the door from behind.

“What’s happening?!” Sam yelled as he and Lyla grabbed me.

“Don’t worry! Just run!” We all began running towards the main entrance.

A huge boulder fell from above blocking the main entrance, then the ground began shaking much faster.
Another boulder fell from above, this time directly above us. I lost my balance and fell forwards pulling my siblings away from the boulders trajectory. The boulder landed and made a huge hole in the ground, the ground surrounding the hole began to break and soon we all fell into the hole.

“AHHHH!” everyone shouted as they went through free fall, we weren’t alone, many people fell with us. That wasn’t the problem.

I grabbed both of my siblings mid-air and turned my back towards the ground and kept my siblings above me.

“BRACE YOURSELVES!” I shouted as we continued to close the gap between us and the ground.

My siblings grasped my body very hard, I couldn’t do anything else, I was dying, or would be dying. It didn’t matter, as long as Sam and Lyla lived.
I hugged them both one last time as I hit the ground below, only a moment to think was left before I lost consciousness.

*Man, the day I was supposed to enjoy the most was ruined… if heaven is real, then dear god, you’d better repent on your actions, screw you…*

![scene break](assets/scene.png)

“Ugh…” I groaned as I tried to get up. I couldn’t, something wasn’t letting me.

I tried to face up, but I couldn’t. After struggling for a bit, I was able to see what was blocking me. It was a block of concrete.

*A block of concrete fell on me? How the hell am I alive?!*
I began panicking and tried to find an opening. Soon enough I found a hole, a small one. Fortunately, I could remove some small rocks, move them outside, and make the hole wider to escape.

“GODDAMMIT! WHY WONT’CHA LEAVE ME ALONE!” Someone yelled from outside.

*What’s happening outside?!*

I quickly removed some rocks near the hole to make it wide enough to see through.

“FINE! IF YOU WON’T I’LL KILL EVERYBODY! GYAHAHAHAH!” He let out a murderous laugh.

I positioned my head near the hole so I could see what was happening outside. I saw a skinny man with a jet-pack-like thing attached to his back, he was laughing maniacally as robotic arms came out from his jet pack and threw boulders forward.
I struggled to move my head closer to the hole to get a better view. There were three people, moving forward dodging all the boulders the madman threw at them.

“HEY! STOP THIS YOU PIECE OF-” A guy got hit by a boulder and was sent flying towards me as he was shouting.

*What…*

I simply lied there. Trying to understand stuff incomprehensible to me, trying to think.

*What do I…do…*

The other two people scrambled their way to the fallen guy trying to help him up, then suddenly they leapt and ran away. There was a boulder coming straight at me. I braced for the impact to minimize damage, but why was I minimizing damage? I should’ve been dead.

The boulder hit me, and it hurt, but the concrete block that was not letting me move was shattered. I was free.

I struggled to move out of the debris, then I caught something in my peripheral vision. Two dead bodies lying on the floor.
I struggled my way out of the debris, all my muscles were sore, and it hurt like hell. But I didn’t stop. I couldn’t stop.

“THERE’S A KID HERE!” A woman shouted, but I couldn’t care less.

*Shut up or the madman will look at me...*

I gathered all the energy I had in my body and ran all I could towards the dead bodies.

“HEY KID! GET A TASTE OF THIS BOULDER! GYAHAHAH!”

*Crap...*

I panicked as I looked to my left, there was a large block of concrete flying towards me. I quickly leapt forward, dodged the boulder, and landed near the two dead bodies.

“GET AWAY!” Someone shouted, but I didn’t listen.

Tears rolled down my eyes as I looked at the two corpses in front of me. The corpses of Lyla and Sam.

*NO! NO, NO, NO, NO… PLEASE NO!*

I quickly put my hand on the left side of their chests and checked their pulse. No beat. They weren’t breathing. They’re dead.

*Why…*

I hugged the corpses tightly, not believing that they were dead.

*Why… don’t die on me!*

“NO USE THEY’RE ALL DEAD! YOUR FAMILY, FRIENDS BLAH BLAH BLAH! I DON’T CARE! THEY’RE ALL DEAD! GYAHAHAH!” He shouted.

*What… what enjoyment do you… get out of this huh? Do you… think this is funny?! You-*

I shouted in my mind as a stream of water rolled down my cheeks.

*Krkkk!*

Something fell on my head. It felt like glass, my head felt watery. It hurt, hurt real bad.

“WHY?!” I shouted as anger welled up inside me.

I experienced a tingling sensation in my head and suddenly my body seemed like it was a size bigger. It felt like my intelligence was fading away.

"WHAT HAPPENED TO HIM?!" Someone shouted.

![scene break](assets/scene.png)

Shiroko Koneko panicked as she saw the boy’s muscles got bigger.

“Um… What happened to him?!” I shouted as I looked at Jeremy.

“I don’t know! Something fell on him and then his body suddenly got bigger!”

“Either way it’s bad news!” Captain Jim shouted.

The boy got up putting aside the corpses of what seemed like his family.

“What’s he… doing?” Becky came from behind panting heavily.

The boy turned towards the madman. His eyes pure red, his pupils white. There was pure rage in his eyes. His hair turned crimson.

A chill ran down Shiroko’s spine as the boy started walking towards the madman.

“I… got a bad feeling-” Just as she was talking the boy suddenly vanished.

“Wha- where did he go?” Everyone began to look for him.

Then they all saw the madman on the floor. Getting heavy punches drilled into him with every punch created a loud sound.

“STOP HIM HE’S GONNA KILL HIM!” Jim ordered and everyone ran towards the boy.

Every second a large thud concealed the area.

*Is he trying to kill him?!*

Everyone ran towards the boy.She panicked and grabbed the boys arm and the boy stopped.

*I did it!*

The boy turned around and looked at Shiroko.

*Eep! Scary!*

The boy looked back at the madman and continued beating him.

*It’s not working?!*

Everyone grabbed the boys right arm which was now covered with blood.

But the boy continued beating him with his left arm.

“NO USE! PULL HIM ASIDE!” Jim ordered and everyone grabbed the boys body and tried to him back.

The boy stopped and then began moving away.

“It’s working…”

The boy vanished again and appeared on top of the madman.

“CRAP IT ISN’T!”

She ran back to him grabbed him again, more like a hug from behind.

“STOP IT!” She yelled. He didn’t stop.

“DON’T DO THIS!” He didn’t listen.

“KILLING WON’T DO ANYTHING!” She yelled with all her might.

The thud sounds got nullified. It was pure silence now.

*I… did it…*

Everyone came from behind and grabbed the boy and took him behind.

“Let’s go, our work here is done.” Jim said as he grabbed hold of the boy.

*He… almost killed him. He got angry.*

She looked at the madman’s face.

“AH!” She screamed.

“Did something happen!” Jim asked as he looked back.

“N-nothing!” She shouted back.

The madman’s face was now the disoriented and deformed form of what it was before.

*His face…*

# Chapter 0: Prologue
Everyone was running towards the chamber,  every single one of them had the word “panic” written on their faces. Why wouldn’t they? After all, the devil had come to reap their lives.

“Everyone don’t let your guard down!” A mercenary shouted
But looking at the crowd they probably didn’t give a shit about that. They just wanted to kill the man in front of them who had the bounty of 5 million.

Not that they could though, because the in front of them was no ordinary man, you can tell by his 5 million bounty, he was no average Joe, heck his head probably had even more worth than that.

“Do they seriously think they can take me on with these numbers?” A shadowy figure said in deep monotonous voice while standing at a pile of bodies.

“They are fools master, they think that they can scratch the great Ambassador with just 500 people” a robot bowed with his head down to the shadowy figure.

“They indeed are…” he had an emotionless face, he showed no concern for what was happening around him.

“Give me the ‘stuff’” he said as he reached his hand forward, “Here, master” a compartment in the robots chest opened, there was a plastic bag in it. He handed the bag with both his arms to the hand.

He picked up the bag and opened it, he took out the stuff inside it and started eating it.

“Mm… Vera, you never disappoint, your chips are top-notch in terms for seasoning” he kept eating while looking at his surroundings as if he was seeing a movie.

“I’m not worthy of such praise master...” Vera modestly turned down his praise.

“The hell is he doing?!” Someone shouted from below.

“They’d better not start making noise all of a sudden when I’m relaxing…” he said as he kept munching down on his chips.

*It’s such a hassle when people come shouting at you when you’re eating, such a pain in the ass…* he thought, this wasn’t the first time something like this happening to him. He encountered these type of incidents pretty often.

“Hey, wannabe devil come down here so we can kick ya’ ass!” Another shout came from below.

“My, they’re now badmouthing me…” he said, without his expression changing he still kept eating chips as he analyzed the environment.

“Master, should I take care of them?”  Vera asked while looking down.

“No need. You just enjoy the show…” he gave his tasty bag o’ chips to Vera and jumped down.

“Um… was that really necessary?” Vera questioned as he went down.

The answer was that it wasn’t, he just did it to look cool.

“Hey! Can’t you guys see I’m eating!” He shouted as he landed on the floor.

“EVERYONE CHARGE!” A brute came behind from the crowd and started running towards him.

“Eh… so you won’t listen to my backstory? No helping it then” he said in a disappointed voice.

Everyone charged at him with killing intent, but that didn’t change anything, he was already the winner.

The Ambassador put his hand on his face and shifted his bottom part of the palm down revealing this left eye between his thumb and index finger.

“DOMINION!” he shouted, his pupils and hair turned golden.

“DON’T FALTER!” The brute shouted as he marched forward with increasing speed.

“FISSION!” He turned into disappeared, no trace of him except dust particles.

“Huh?” The brute was dumbfounded, he looked desperately around to find him.
*Damn it! Where did that coward run off to?!* The brute thought, but the man didn’t run away he had actually turned into subatomic particles because of his speed.

When the brute looked behind everyone was lying on the flood.
“H-How?!” He grit his teeth.
“Show yourself coward!” He shouted.

“Geez… can’t you be a little less louder…” the man said as he came back into being as dust particles gathered.

“I’LL KILL YOU!” The brute leaped forward.
But the man did nothing he brought up his hand to his left shoulder and swiped off some dust.
He walked forward, as if nothing had happened. His swipe was so fast for the eye that he couldn’t see it and he took advantage of it and swiped off the brutes head along with the dust on his shoulder.

Vera came down gliding and landed on the ground and bowed to his master.

“Our business here is done. Let’s just take the ‘stuff’ and leave.” he said as he cracked his knuckles.

“Yes master.” Vera said and looked over what had happened here, he took down more than five hundred people in a matter of minutes.

“Oh, I forgot, I have a meeting so… can I leave the work to you?” He asked Vera as he examined his surroundings.

“Yes master.” Just as Vera said that he had disappeared, again without any trace except some dust particles.
*Incredible…* Vera thought as he recalled the experience from before.
*As expected of the Extrenof lineage...*

He looked around, in the middle of the corpses he spotted a door.

After some time he reached the door. He entered into a dimly lot room, there was a single glass container in the middle of the room with a strange orangutan-red colored fruit in it.

He clenched his fist and punched through the glass and it broke, he picked up the fruit and started examining it.
*I wonder how powerful master will become after eating this…*

“So… what happened?” the Ambassador asked.

“We can talk about it, take a seat” an old man poured a drink on a glass cup.

The Ambassador sat across the old man in a sofa.

“There’s something I need help for…” the old man said and gave him a glass of wine.

“What do you need me to do?” He asked as he sipped his drink.

“I’m holding a feast.” The old man said as he looked out of the window.

He nodded as he looked outside the window too.
There was shouting outside, people ran here and there in a panic.

“Run! The Toxins are here!” Someone shouted.

“A lot of ruckus considering it’s still 3 a.m…” the old man said, “I want you to gather everyone you know for this feast…” he said.

“But why though?” The Ambassador asked.

“Cause’ it’s my grandsons 10th birthday!” The old man said as he smiled.

“On it pops. WAIT WHAT GRANDSON?!”
